Harry is a bot that provides you real time information about any cryptocurrency.
Users of your Server will be able to find information about all cryptos, search the content
from a wallet or have information about the price of ETH transactions. 

## Bot Setup
To start make sure you have installed the latest version of NodeJS. After that, download this
repository, open a terminal and go to the download location. Then run:

After that you have to put in `requestRealTimeData` function of `API.js` the Binance url like
`https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr?symbol=`, then you have to put your Binance API key in
the `X-MBX-APIKEY` field of the request header.
